Fixed point conversion:
	Steps:
		Levelization
			Breaking the complex expressions into single operator form : translation of expressions into polynomial approximation terms
		Scalarization
			Breaking vector operations into sets of scalar operations
		Computation of the ranges of variables
			-set MAX and MIN  for the inputs
			-sweep through the inputs and find the MAX and MIN for all the intermediate variables
			-calculate the number of bits needed to represent the integer part of each variable
		Generation of the fixed point MATLAB code
			-this is translated to the effort for designing width configurable modules on hardware
