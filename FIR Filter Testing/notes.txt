using fircls on MATLAB for generating a sample FIR filter

you have to give it:
number of taps (n)
transition freqs (f)
amplitudes in each freq band (a)
up and lo freq response limits in each band

it gives you:
the coeffs of the filter

how to test FIR filter implementation (this can be the way to compare the fixed point versions with each other? hopefully)

1. impulse test
	one "1" followed by at least N-1 "0"
2. step test
	at least N "1"
3. Sine test
	test different freq passing through filter



approaches that I can think of right now:

1. implement the test sin wave for testing myself? (time consuming and not scalable)
2. is it possible to write a program on LabVIEW to control a wave generator and get the sin waves with desired frequencies with the pace I need for each loop of my simulation?!
